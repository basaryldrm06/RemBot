## How It Works?
REM stands for RSI-EMA-MACD

When certain conditions are met, Bot enters position automatically.

```bash
    while True:
        if (MACD_12 > MACD_26) and (MACD_12 < 0) and (EMA_100 > price) and (RSI_6 > 50):
            # Enter LONG...
        
        elif (MACD_12 < MACD_26) and (MACD_12 > 0) and (EMA_100 < price) and (RSI_6 < 50):
            # Enter SHORT...
```

2. **Binance API:** RemBot connects seamlessly to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange through its API, allowing real-time access to market data and execution of trades.

3. **TA-Lib Library:** Technical Analysis Library provides essential functions for technical analysis of financial markets, aiding RemBot in evaluating market indicators.

4. **ChatGPT:** ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, is employed for code assistance, aiding developers in coding tasks and providing guidance on library usage. Additionally, ChatGPT is used for crafting informative log messages, enhancing communication and facilitating a smoother understanding of RemBot's operations.

## Installation

To install Project, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Install Python:**  
	- Visit [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download python. 
	- I strongly recommend downloading a version lower than 3.10 and higher than 3 to ensure that you can download it without any issues and run the Talib library smoothly.
2. **Cloning the Project into your local:**
    Go to the directory where you want to download the project using 'cd', and then type the following command
    ```bash
    $git clone https://github.com/basaryldrm06/RemBot
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
    Enter these commands in sequence.
    ```bash
    $cd RemBot
    $pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Upon successfully completing these steps, proceed to configure your settings and run the program.

In case you encounter any issues, kindly attempt to resolve them before moving forward.

If you are facing difficulties downloading the Talib library, consider trying a manual download from this [link](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).

## Configuration
Rename the file config2.py to config.py.

Open the config.py file to edit the settings, and fill in the empty fields according to your preferences.

If you do not have an api key you can obtain one from this [link](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management)

You can use the default values for other sections or customize them based on your preferences.

Once you have finished editing your settings, you will be ready to run the program.

## Running the Bot
If you have completed the previous steps, RemBot is now ready to run. Start it by entering the following command:

 ```bash
$python main.py
```

After running the command, you should see a screen similar to the one below.
